# Digital-Clock-in-C
This project is a Digital Clock application built using the C programming language. It runs directly in the terminal and displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format, updating every second.

-> Features :
Real-time clock display in the console.
Automatically updates hours, minutes, and seconds.
Simple and minimal UI.
Utilizes standard C libraries.

-> Technologies Used :
Language: C
Library: <time.h> for retrieving and manipulating system time.
System Functions: Used for creating timed delays (sleep() or Sleep() depending on OS).

-> What I Learned :
Handling system time in C.
Implementing loops for real-time updates.
Using terminal output formatting.
